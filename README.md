NInfer-3090 is a specialized C++20/CUDA inference engine for **Qwen3.8-27B** and Qwen3.6 on one
24 GB NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090. Qwen3.8-27B is a first-class, tested target: the native SM86
runtime loads its official groupwise `.ninfer` artifact, serves OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible
APIs, and supports paged KV, compatible-prefix reuse, CUDA Graphs, MTP speculative decoding,
reasoning-effort control, ReplaySSM state transactions, and concurrent cohorts through **C8**.

Community project, maintained on a best-effort basis. Issues and PRs are very welcome, but support
and feature requests are not guaranteed.



On an RTX 3090, Qwen3.8-27B supports a measured **171K-token INT8 context** with the standard
1 GiB safety headroom.

This fork targets `sm_86`. Blackwell-only NVFP4/W4A4 and FP8 A8 tensor-core execution are
unavailable. FP8 and NVFP4 *weights* are admitted through their A16 dequantizing routes, but the
FP8 E4M3 *KV-cache* profile is not: its attention kernels have no SM86 implementation. 

The goal is the make the utmost rippin Qwen inference stack for the 3000 series. Gladly taking PR's, all help much appreciated. 

Release notes for this branch: [v0.6.1](RELEASE_NOTES_0.6.1.md).

## Choose a platform

| Platform | Delivery | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Docker image or native source build | [Linux build guide](docs/rtx-3090-linux.md) |
| Windows 11 | Prebuilt release archive | [Windows guide](docs/rtx-3090-windows.md) |

### Linux

The Dockerfile gives the shortest build path on Bazzite and other Linux distributions:

```bash
docker build --tag ninfer-3090:sm86 .
```

The Linux guide contains the GPU check, native Ubuntu build, model mount, server command, and Bash
launchers. The project does not publish a prebuilt Linux archive or qualified Linux performance
results yet.

### Windows 11

1. Download and unzip the latest [Windows release](https://github.com/Don-Chad/ninfer-3090/releases/latest).
2. Double-click `download-qwen38.bat` to download the model. Interrupted downloads resume.
3. Double-click one launcher:

| Launcher | Best for |
|---|---|
| `run-qwen38-c1.bat` | One interactive user, lowest latency, up to 64K context |
| `run-qwen38-c8.bat` | Multiple users or agents, highest aggregate throughput, 8K context |
| `run-qwen38-vision.bat` | Qwen3.8 image understanding, one user, 32K context, MTP3 |
| `run-qwen36-35b-vision.bat` | Image understanding with Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, one user, 32K context |

The API is then available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`. The Windows archive includes the required
applications and DLLs.

## Qwen3.8-27B support and RTX 3090 results

Qwen3.8-27B is validated from one through eight simultaneous users. ReplaySSM cuts the memory cost
of speculative decoding, allowing the faster MTP3 mode to remain enabled at C8. The table below is
the new sustained test: every request generated 1,024 tokens with CUDA Graphs enabled.

The prompts were **29-34 input tokens** and the server's maximum context window was **8,192 tokens
per request**. Each measured sequence therefore reached roughly 1,053-1,058 tokens including its
generated output. This is a long-output/decode benchmark, not an 8K-prompt or long-prefill test.
C1-C4 used an 8,192-token shared KV pool; C8 used 16,384 tokens so all eight requested outputs
could be admitted simultaneously.

| Cohort | Total output | End-to-end throughput | Decode throughput | MTP acceptance | Mean TTFT | Peak VRAM |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C1 | 1,024 tokens | **70.19 tok/s** | **71.00 tok/s** | 61.13% | 149 ms | 19,641 MiB |
| C2 | 2,048 tokens | **89.43 tok/s** | **90.66 tok/s** | 59.66% | 262 ms | 20,022 MiB |
| C4 | 4,096 tokens | **97.89 tok/s** | **100.28 tok/s** | 59.63% | 538 ms | 20,641 MiB |
| C8 | 8,192 tokens | **161.28 tok/s** | **165.33 tok/s** | 56.84% | 1,215 ms | 22,138 MiB |

C1 is the responsive choice for a single user. C8 delivers **2.3x the total throughput** when
several requests are active. The C8 long-output test uses a 16K shared KV pool so all eight
1,024-token responses can be admitted together.

### Prompt-processing speed

Prompt processing was tested separately with **4,362 fresh input tokens per request**, an 8,192-token
per-request context window, 512-token prefill chunks, INT8 KV, ReplaySSM/MTP3, CUDA Graphs, and
prefix reuse disabled. Each request generated only 16 tokens so the run measures prefill rather
than long decode.

| Cohort | Total fresh input | Aggregate prefill | Active-prefill speed | Mean TTFT | Peak VRAM |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C1 | 4,362 tokens | **861.51 tok/s** | 893.98 tok/s | 4,893 ms | 19,114 MiB |
| C2 | 8,724 tokens | **853.86 tok/s** | 883.95 tok/s | 7,478 ms | 19,697 MiB |
| C4 | 17,448 tokens | **847.26 tok/s** | 874.49 tok/s | 12,692 ms | 20,894 MiB |
| C8 | 34,896 tokens | **844.10 tok/s** | 870.94 tok/s | 23,028 ms | 23,207 MiB |

`Aggregate prefill` is total fresh input tokens divided by the complete request-wave time, so it is
the user-facing throughput number. NInfer currently processes one long prefill at a time; cohort
batching accelerates decode, but does not multiply prompt ingestion. Consequently C1-C8 remain near
844-862 input tok/s while queued requests increase mean TTFT. `Active-prefill speed` excludes queue
waiting and measures only the server's recorded prefill phase.

### RotorQuant KV (`rk8v4`) — currently unavailable

`rk8v4` was an experimental, opt-in KV-cache mode for Qwen3.8-27B that applied a normalized
transform to queries and keys, rotated values before four-bit storage, and reversed the value
transform after attention.

It is **not available in this build**. Upstream now owns KV quantization in a dedicated
`kv_cache_append` Op, whose published numerical contract rotates K with a normalized H256
transform and stores V from unrotated BF16 source values. rk8v4's H64 rotation and int4-V
representation have no implementation against that contract yet, so `--kv-dtype rk8v4` parses but
is rejected during engine construction rather than silently degrading to INT8.

Porting RotorQuant onto the new Op is tracked as follow-up work. Until then the previously
published 226,560-token and 247,872-token RotorQuant context measurements do not describe this
build. Use `--kv-dtype int8`, which reaches 171,648 tokens at the 1 GiB headroom boundary.

### Qwen3.8 vision

The same Qwen3.8 artifact supports images. Start the server with `--vision`, MTP3, INT8 KV, and a
32K maximum context. The Windows archive includes `run-qwen38-vision.bat` for this profile.

A 1,920×1,080 image expanded to 2,074 prompt tokens and was read correctly. Measured TTFT was
3.29 seconds, decode reached 98.1 tok/s, MTP acceptance was 96.7%, and startup retained 2.16 GiB
free VRAM. The artifact also declares multi-image and video support; this release test directly
validated a single image.

## Qwen3.6-35B-A3B RTX 3090 results

Measured with the compact 20.84 GiB 35B-A3B artifact, a 4K shared INT8 group-64 paged KV pool,
CUDA Graphs, MTP3, greedy decoding, and no competing GPU workload:

| Concurrent requests | 128 output tokens each | Observed VRAM |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 162.7 aggregate tok/s | 22,427 MiB |
| 2 | 267.9 aggregate tok/s | 22,743 MiB |
| 4 | 366.2 aggregate tok/s | 23,377 MiB |
| 6 | 383.4 aggregate tok/s | 24,038 MiB |
| 8 | rejected at startup | about 503 MiB over the safe reservation limit |

A longer 512-token-per-request check reached **286.8 tok/s at C1** and **399.1 aggregate tok/s at
C2**. These short-prompt measurements include request-level timing and are not directly comparable
to v0.3.1's 1,500-token adaptive prompt-lookup benchmark.

Compatible-prefix reuse was validated end to end: a repeated 26-token prompt reused 24 tokens,
reducing measured prefill from 371 ms to 10 ms.

### Qwen3.6-35B vision

The compact 35B artifact includes its vision encoder and accepts images through the same OpenAI-
compatible API. Start the server with `--vision` and leave speculative decoding disabled. The
Windows archive includes `run-qwen36-35b-vision.bat` for this profile.

The safe RTX 3090 profile is **one request, 32K maximum context, INT8 KV, vision enabled, and MTP
disabled**. A current v0.6 test processed three 1,920×1,080 images correctly. Each image expanded
to a 2,081-token prompt; engine TTFT was 3.76–4.07 seconds, decode was about 159 tok/s, and peak
VRAM was 23,944 MiB. This leaves little room for another GPU workload.

MTP is intentionally off for this profile. At 32K, speculative recurrent state would exceed the
3090 memory budget; KV compression alone does not recover enough memory. Text-only 35B profiles can
still use MTP3 as documented above.

## Supported artifacts

| Model | Artifact | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B v1 | [pinned compact artifact](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer/tree/c8b8c1c0df4c74df3c190c6aa3a7f24dc614721c) | 20.84 GiB | **Recommended for RTX 3090; text C1-C6 at 4K and vision C1 at 32K** |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B v2 | [current upstream artifact](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer) | 21.22 GiB | Reader supported by v0.5+; includes DFlash payload and is not the measured 3090 artifact |
| Qwen3.6-27B | [groupwise artifact](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-NInfer) | 16.29 GiB | Supported with more runtime headroom |
| **Qwen3.8-27B** | [official NInfer groupwise artifact](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer) | 16.96 GiB | **Validated at C1, C2, C4 and C8/MTP3 with ReplaySSM** |

NInfer-3090 v0.5 and newer recognize both v1 and v2 container magic. The current 21.22 GiB v2
artifact contains additional DFlash weights and is not the artifact used for the published RTX
3090 concurrency results. The pinned compact v1 artifact keeps the measured model payload and
omits DFlash, providing the known 24 GB memory profile.

## Models and platform support

Linux users build the applications from source or use the Docker image. Windows users can use the
prebuilt archive, which includes the applications and required DLLs. Both platforms require an
RTX 3090 or RTX 3090 Ti and a recent NVIDIA driver.

Download the [official Qwen3.8 artifact](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer) as
`models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer`. Windows users can run `download-qwen38.bat` instead.

For Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, the smaller
[pinned container-v1 artifact](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer/tree/c8b8c1c0df4c74df3c190c6aa3a7f24dc614721c)
is recommended on a 24 GB card. Releases v0.5 and newer also read the larger container-v2 file.
An `artifact magic is not NInfer version 1` message means the executable is outdated, not that the
current model download is necessarily corrupt.

Developers can build from source on Windows or Linux. Windows uses Visual Studio 2022 and vcpkg.
Linux uses GCC 13 with system packages or the pinned vcpkg manifest. Both builds require CUDA 12.8
or newer and CMake 3.28 or newer.

See the [Windows build guide](docs/rtx-3090-windows.md) or the
[Linux build guide](docs/rtx-3090-linux.md). Ordinary Windows release users do not need these tools.

## Qwen3.8 reasoning effort

Qwen3.8-27B supports distinct reasoning-effort modes. `medium` uses the model's normal thinking
prompt. `xhigh` injects the checkpoint's extended deliberation instruction, asking it to validate
assumptions and consider alternatives. This is a real prompt-template change, not a sampling alias.

| Value | Qwen3.8 behavior |
|---|---|
| `none` | Disable thinking |
| `low` | Keep reasoning brief and focused |
| `medium` | Use normal Qwen3.8 thinking |
| `xhigh` | Use extended deliberation and verification |

OpenAI Chat Completions accepts a top-level `reasoning_effort` field:

```json
{
  "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Solve this carefully..."}],
  "reasoning_effort": "xhigh",
  "max_tokens": 4096
}
```

OpenAI Responses uses `"reasoning": {"effort": "xhigh"}`. Anthropic Messages uses
`"output_config": {"effort": "xhigh"}`. For the native CLI, pass
`--reasoning-effort low|medium|xhigh`; use `--no-thinking` instead of an effort to disable
reasoning. Chat Completions returns hidden reasoning separately as `message.reasoning_content`.

## Serving APIs

The server supports:

- OpenAI Chat Completions;
- OpenAI Responses Core with streaming and local continuation state;
- Anthropic Messages;
- compatible-prefix reuse;
- prompt-rendered function tools and parsed tool calls;
- bounded pending-request admission and JSONL request logs.

See [HTTP serving](docs/serving.md) and [CLI usage](docs/cli.md).

## How cohort batching works

The C number is the maximum number of requests NInfer can run together. C1 favors one interactive
user; C8 can combine up to eight active requests into each GPU step for much higher total output.

Follow-up requests do not need to arrive at the same instant. When a running request finishes, the
next waiting request can join at a safe generation boundary. Empty or finished lanes are skipped,
so a C8 server also works normally with only one, two, or four active users.

This is deliberately more bounded than datacenter-style dynamic batching. The maximum number of
users and GPU memory are chosen when the server starts. In return, memory use stays predictable on
a 24 GB card and the server can reuse fast CUDA Graphs instead of rebuilding work continuously.

## Current limits

- One process owns one model on one RTX 3090.
- Concurrency is fixed at startup and limited to 1-8 by the API; compact 35B fits C1-C6 and
  Qwen3.8-27B fits C8/8K with MTP3 through ReplaySSM.
- The shared KV pool is fixed at startup and is not divided statically among request lanes.
- This is bounded small-scale batching, not preemptive large-scale continuous batching.
- No multi-GPU execution or CPU/GPU weight offload.
- Tool calls are returned to the client but are not executed by NInfer.
- NVFP4 A4, FP8 A8, and TMA kernels require Blackwell and are unavailable on SM86. FP8 and NVFP4
  weights are admitted through their A16 dequantizing routes.
- The paged runtime exposes BF16 and INT8 group-64 KV; INT8 remains the quality-default path.
  Upstream's row-scaled FP8 E4M3 KV profile and `rk8v4` both parse but are rejected on SM86.

## Validation

The v0.6.0 Windows gate covered Qwen3.8 generation, materialization, request memory, admission,
paged KV, prefix reuse, speculative rounds, and SM86 W8 Linear paths.

The v0.6.1 Linux source gate completed all 245 Docker compile and link steps with CUDA 13.1 on
Ubuntu 24.04. Both Linux applications returned their `--help` output with GPU access enabled.
A real-artifact Linux generation and Linux performance qualification remain open.

## Upstream

This fork traces to [Neroued/ninfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) through
[Don-Chad/ninfer-3090](https://github.com/Don-Chad/ninfer-3090). The upstream
[Neroued/ninfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) project targets RTX 5090/`sm_120a`; the
[Don-Chad/ninfer-3090](https://github.com/Don-Chad/ninfer-3090) fork carries the Windows and Linux
SM86 compatibility layer, compact 35B artifact support, and RTX 3090-specific schedules and memory
planning. This repository ([yangkang5303/ninfer-3090](https://github.com/yangkang5303/ninfer-3090))
adds RTX 3080 support on top of that.
